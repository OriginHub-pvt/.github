# 🌐 OriginHub

**OriginHub** is an open innovation platform that transforms real-world problems into validated startup ideas, powered by AI and modern MLOps practices.  

Our goal is to help **entrepreneurs, students, and developers** move from *problem discovery* → *market validation* → *startup creation*.

## 🚀 What We Are Building
Many existing idea-generation tools produce vague or repetitive outputs, while valuable insights remain scattered across forums and communities. OriginHub addresses this challenge by:  

- 📌 Allowing users to **submit structured problems**.  
- 🤖 Using **AI + human validation pipelines** to research solutions, identify gaps, and generate actionable startup roadmaps.  
- 🧩 Creating **collaborative idea threads** where users can refine concepts, join teams, and build together.  
- 🌟 Showcasing **launched projects and startups**, giving them visibility and feedback loops.  

From a technical perspective, OriginHub also serves as an **MLOps case study**, demonstrating best practices in data ingestion, preprocessing, model training/serving, versioning, CI/CD, and monitoring.

OriginHub is organized into modular repositories:  

- **originhub-frontend** → Next.js/React user interface for problem submissions and idea threads.  
- **originhub-backend** → FastAPI/Django backend for APIs, data ingestion, and ML integration.  
- **originhub-ml** → Machine learning pipelines for classification, deduplication, and roadmap generation.  
- **originhub-infra** → Infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD workflows, and deployment automation.  
- **originhub-docs** → Documentation, architecture diagrams, and developer guides.  
- **originhub-datasets** → Version-controlled datasets with DVC for reproducibility.
