# 🌐 OriginHub – AI-Powered Startup Intelligence & SWOT Engine

**OriginHub** is an open innovation platform that transforms real-world problems into validated startup ideas, powered by AI and modern MLOps practices.  

Our goal is to help **entrepreneurs, students, and developers** move from *problem discovery* → *market validation* → *startup creation*.

🚀 **What We Are Building**

Traditional idea-generation tools often provide generic suggestions without understanding real market dynamics — while valuable startup insights are buried across hundreds of news sites and feeds. OriginHub bridges this gap by turning global startup data into actionable intelligence.

**OriginHub – AI-Powered Startup Intelligence & SWOT Engine** continuously scans the web, summarizes emerging innovations, and helps founders discover opportunities before they go mainstream.

💡 **What OriginHub Does**

🔍**Aggregates startup intelligence**
Automatically fetches and processes startup news from multiple RSS feeds (e.g., TechCrunch, Product Hunt, Wired, VentureBeat) — ensuring comprehensive and up-to-date market coverage.

🧠 **Summarizes and categorizes innovations**
Uses LLMs to generate concise, domain-aware summaries and categorize them into key sectors (AI, FinTech, ClimateTech, etc.).

📈 **Builds a semantic knowledge base**
Converts summaries into vector embeddings and stores them in a vector database, enabling semantic search for similar startups or technologies.

🧩**Performs AI-driven SWOT analysis**
Given a user’s idea or problem statement, OriginHub finds relevant existing players and auto-generates a SWOT report (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), helping users identify differentiation and monetization paths.

⚙️**Runs as a production-grade MLOps pipeline**
Each stage — data ingestion, summarization, embedding, and vector storage — runs as modular Airflow DAGs.
The system implements incremental updates, checkpointing (SQL), GCP storage, retry logic, and monitoring, showcasing best practices in MLOps design and automation.
